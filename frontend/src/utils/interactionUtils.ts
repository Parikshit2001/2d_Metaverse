// isPlayerNearObject(player, object, interactionDistance):

// Calculates the distance between the player and an object to determine if the player is close enough to interact with it. This is useful for things like sitting in a chair, opening a door, or picking up an item.
// handleObjectInteraction(player, object, interactionCallback):

// If the player is near an interactive object, it calls a custom interaction function. For example, it could trigger a door to open or allow the player to sit in a chair.
// interactWithChair(player):

// Example function that logs when the player interacts with a chair. This is where you would add more specific logic (e.g., change the player's animation to a sitting position).
